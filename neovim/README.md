# Neovim config

## What is this project?
Kickstart's design philosophy is to give a very barebones starting point but have you ever felt like, having a system that is both barebones and jazzy?

This here is a very opinionated setup for kickstart, that adds prettier UI without sacrificing the lightweight nature of kickstart just clone, delete `.git` and you're good to go

## How to install:
This guide here assumes that you've got neovim installed, check your OS/distro instruction on how to install it.

### Installing as your basic config:

#### Prepare for installation:

sudo pacman -S neovim

# remove or backup your previous config
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.bak

# remove cached stuff
rm -rf ~/.local/state/nvim/ && rm -rf ~/.local/share/nvim/
```
#### Clone the repo (linux distros) : 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/greed-d/nvim-minimal ~/.config/nvim && nvim
